 <p><b>Blood is classified into different groups based on the presence or absence of specific antigens. The main blood groups are:</b></p><br>

        <h2>O Positive</h2>
        <p>Thirty-nine percent of the United States population has O-Positive blood, making it the most common blood type. Type O+ donors can help change the world by donating double red cells . </p> 
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3> <b>Quick Facts </b></h3>
            <li>Because 39% of the population have type O+ blood, hospitals transfuse it more often than other blood types.</li>
            <li>Preferred donation methods: double red blood cell, whole blood, and platelet.</li>
            <li>Types O, A, B and AB positive can receive O+ red cells,(except childbearing aged females of types O-, A-,B-and AB).</li>
            <li>Type O+ can ONLY receive types O+ and O-, and only type O+ and O- can receive O+ plasma.</li>

        <h2>O Negative</h2>
        <p>Only 9% of the population has Type O- blood, yet it is the blood type in the highest demand. Type O- donors can help change the world by donating double red cells (an apheresis procedure that takes twice as many red blood cells).</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>The Universal Donor</h3>
        <p>Type O-Negative donors are universal donors. This means that their red blood cells can be transfused to any patient, regardless of the recipient's blood type. <br> In the case of an emergency, doctors often do not have time to determine the blood type of the patient and depend on Type O blood for trauma patients and accident victims.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Quick Facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>7% of the population is type O-.</li>
            <li>O- is the highest in-demand blood type because anyone can receive O- red blood cells, although O- plasma can only be transfused to another type O.</li>
            <li>Type O- red cells can be used for any patient but are especially needed for emergencies, for babies, and for those with weakened immune systems.</li>
            <li>Preferred donation methods: double red blood cell and whole blood.</li>
            <li>Doctors depend on type O blood for trauma patients and accident victims.</li>
            <li>Although anyone can receive O- blood cells, type O- can only receive type O- blood.</li>

    <h2>A Positive</h2>
    <p>Type A+ donors can help change the world by donating whole blood and by donating platelets (an apheresis procedure that takes longer but often goes to cancer patients). And Type A and AB plasma are often used for trauma patients and accident victims.</p>
 </div>
 <div>
   <h3>Quick Facts</h3>
   <ul>
       <li>32% of the United States population is A+, making it one of the most-transfused blood types.</li>
       <li>Type A+ is in high demand to treat cancer patients and premature babies.</li>
       <li>In an emergency, doctors depend on type A and AB plasma for trauma patients and accident victims.</li>
       <li>Preferred donation methods: platelet and whole blood.</li>
       <li>Only types A and AB+ can receive type A+, but A+ platelets can go anywhere (except childbearing aged females of types O-, A-, B- and AB-).</li>
