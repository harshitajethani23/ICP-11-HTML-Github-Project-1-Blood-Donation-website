   <div class="description"><b>Here are some unique eligibility criteria questions everyone should know before donating blood. These questions cover common health conditions, lifestyle choices, and other factors that may affect someone's ability to donate blood safely:</b>
    </div>
<h2>Are you at least 17 years old?</h2>
(In some areas, 16-year-olds may donate with parental consent.)

<h2>Have you had a tattoo or piercing in the past 12 months?</h2>
(Depending on local guidelines, this may disqualify you due to potential infections.)

<h2>Do you weigh at least 110 pounds (50 kg)?</h2>
(This ensures that you have enough blood volume to donate safely.)

<h2>Have you had any cold, flu, or other respiratory symptoms in the last 48 hours?</h2>
(This helps protect both the donor and the recipient from possible infections.)

<h2>Are you currently on any medication?</h2>
(Certain medications may disqualify you temporarily or permanently from donating.)

<h2>Have you traveled to a malaria-endemic region in the past year?</h2>
(Travel to certain regions may increase the risk of malaria transmission.)

<h2>Do you have any history of heart disease or stroke?</h2>
(Donors with these conditions may be at a higher risk of complications during or after donation.)

<h2>Have you recently undergone any surgery, or are you planning surgery soon?</h2>
(This is to ensure your body has fully recovered and is in optimal condition.)

<h2>Do you have a history of blood-borne diseases, such as HIV, hepatitis, or syphilis?</h2>
(Donors with these conditions are typically not eligible due to the risk of transmission.)

<h2>Are you pregnant or have you given birth within the last 6 months?</h2>
(Pregnant women and new mothers may be temporarily disqualified to ensure their health and recovery.)

<h2>Have you been drinking alcohol or using recreational drugs recently?</h2>
(These substances can affect your blood and your ability to donate safely.)

<h2>Do you have any chronic medical conditions like diabetes, epilepsy, or asthma?</h2>
(Certain conditions may require additional assessment before donating.)

<h2>Have you donated blood in the last 56 days?</h2>
(Blood donation centers typically recommend waiting at least 56 days between whole blood donations.)

<h2>Have you recently experienced significant stress, emotional or physical trauma?</h2>
(Stress can affect the body’s ability to recover from blood donation.)

<h2>Do you have any allergies, especially to medications, latex, or blood products?</h2>
(Allergies can impact the donation process and your safety.)
