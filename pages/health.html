        Before donating blood, there are several health eligibility criteria that ensure both the donor's safety and the
        safety of the recipient. These criteria are meant to ensure that you are healthy enough to donate blood and that
        your donation will be safe and beneficial. Below are the general health requirements for blood donation:

        <h2>1.General Health Criteria</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Good Overall Health:</b>
                Donors must be in generally good health. This means you should not have any serious illness, infection,
                or medical conditions that could be exacerbated by donating blood.</li>

            <li><b>No Cold or Flu Symptoms:</b>
                You should not have symptoms of a cold, flu, or any other infectious diseases at the time of donation.
                Blood donation centers typically won’t allow donations from people who are actively sick (with fever,
                cough, sore throat, etc.) to prevent the spread of infections.
            </li>
            <li><b>Normal Body Temperature:</b>
                Your body temperature should be normal, typically below 99.5°F (37.5°C). A fever may indicate an
                infection, so a fever could disqualify you from donating blood.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2.Hemoglobin Levels (Iron Levels)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Hemoglobin:</b>
                One of the most important health eligibility criteria is that your hemoglobin levels (the protein in red
                blood cells that carries oxygen) must be within a healthy range. Blood centers typically measure
                hemoglobin before the donation. Low hemoglobin (anemia) may prevent you from donating, as it can lead to
                a drop in iron levels, resulting in fatigue, dizziness, or other complications.</li>

            <li><b>Typical Hemoglobin Levels:</b>

            <li>For women: 12.5 g/dL or higher</li>
            <li>For men: 13.0 g/dL or higher</li>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3.Blood Pressure and Pulse</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Blood Pressure:</b>
                Your blood pressure should be within a normal range, typically systolic (top) 90-180 mmHg and diastolic
                (bottom) 50-100 mmHg. If your blood pressure is too high or too low, you may not be able to donate.</li>

            <li><b>Pulse:</b>
                A normal pulse rate (heart rate) is typically between 50 and 100 beats per minute. If your pulse is too
                high or too low, it may affect your eligibility to donate.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>4.Recent Vaccinations and Infections</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Infections:</b>
            Donors should be free of infections or any active illness, including viral or bacterial infections. If
            you’ve recently had an infection, you may need to wait until you have fully recovered before donating blood.
        </li>
    <li><b>Vaccinations:</b>
        Some vaccinations may require you to wait a period before donating blood. For example, after receiving the
        COVID-19 vaccine, you generally need to wait 48 hours before donating. For other vaccines, such as for hepatitis
        or yellow fever, there may be a waiting period of up to several weeks,depending on the vaccine type.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>5.Recent Medical Procedures</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Surgery:</b>
If you’ve had recent surgery, you may need to wait before donating blood. This could be several weeks to months, depending on the type of surgery. It’s important to ensure that you have fully recovered and that your health is stable before donating.</li>

<li><b>Dental Procedures:</b>
After dental work (like teeth extractions or fillings), you may be required to wait a few weeks before donating blood to ensure that you are not at risk of infection.</li>
</ul>
